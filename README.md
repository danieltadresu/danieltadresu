### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a newbie in just about everything, so first thank you for giving this a read!

I work at [MoveApps](https://www.moveapps.cl/) mainly coding with Javascript on Sails.js, some front with React, and I'm having fun learning about web technologies in general.

I love talking about tech, procrastination and coffee, so feel free to hit me up at danieldev1999@gmail.com with any topics or feedback on what you see over here.
